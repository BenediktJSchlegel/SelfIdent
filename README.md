# SelfIdent - Work in Progress!

### This library is not meant for production use
This project was created to test and experiment with subjects related to authentication and authorization in .NET aswell as password storage. 
While the intent was to make this approach as secure as it can be, because of the nature of the project it is not a safe alternative to industry standard solutions.

This library can however be used for prototyping, development and testing purposes.
